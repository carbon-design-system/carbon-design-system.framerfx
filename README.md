# Carbon Design System

This package implements the [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) from IBM in Framer.

## Components

Most of the components from Carbon have already been implemented. Utility components which do not make sense for prototyping have been excluded

## Documentation

The [Carbon Design System documentation site](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/overview) is a great place to get started when working with these components. You won't always see a 1:1 mapping of the properties of the underlying components to [Framer Property Controls](https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer/property-control-code-component/) but it should give you a good indication of what's already possible with these components.

## Issues/Bugs

This project is currently being maintained by [Iain](https://github.com/iKettles) from the Framer Team. Feel free to ping him on @iKettles if you run into any issues with using the components.
