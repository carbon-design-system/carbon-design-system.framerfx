# Carbon Design System

This package implements the [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) from IBM in Framer.

## Components

Most of the components from Carbon have already been implemented. Utility components which are not useful for prototyping for prototyping have been excluded.

## Documentation

The [Carbon Design System documentation site](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/overview) is a great place to get started when working with these components. You won't always see a 1:1 mapping of the properties of the underlying components to [Framer Property Controls](https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer/property-control-code-component/) but it should give you a good indication of what's already possible.

## Theming

Theming support is coming soon.
